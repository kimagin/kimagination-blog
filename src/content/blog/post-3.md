- **Integration with React**: Designed specifically for React, Motion integrates seamlessly with React components, leveraging the power of React's state and props.

### Enhancing Web Animations with Wappi and Motion

Both Wappi and Motion offer unique advantages for web developers looking to create engaging animations. Here’s how they can be used effectively:

#### Creating Smooth Animations with Wappi

Wappi's simplicity and performance make it ideal for adding smooth animations to any web project. Here’s a basic example of how to use Wappi to animate an element:

```javascript
// Include Wappi in your project
import { animate } from 'wappi'

// Animate an element
animate({
  targets: '#myElement',
  translateX: 250,
  duration: 1000,
  easing: 'easeInOutQuad',
})
```
